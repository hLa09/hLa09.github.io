        <h3> Introduction: </h3>
        <p>I want to build a robot that turn on fan when the surrounding becames hot/humidity, and display the temperature on the display screen. My ultimately goal is to be able to let the user changes the speed of the fan when neccessary. <br> <br>
        For this assignment I plan to have the following materials:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A Robot</li>
          <ul>
            <li>A prototype robot for visualization, and project completeness.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>LCD 1602 module</li>
          <ul>
            <li>To display the temperature of the surrounding</li>
          </ul>
          <li>DC motor and Fan</li>
          <ul>
            <li> To have the fan turning when temperature/ or surrounding get hot/humidity.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>LEDs indicators</li>
          <ul>
            <li> The purpose of the LEDs is to display the temperature meter</li>
            <li> For example: if the temperature cool it Blue, if it warm it's Yellow and while its hot it Red.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>DHT11 Temperature + Humidity</li>
          <ul>
            <li>I plan to use this to check for the surrounding temperature and humidity</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Remote</li>
          <ul>
            <li>My ultimate goal is to have user being able to change the speed of the fan, so I plan to have the remote control being implemented in the project.</li>
            <li> For example if the user want to control from afar they could.</li>
            <li> That means I would need an IR receiver to detect the code from the remote.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <p> <br>For this assignment timeline:
          <ul>
            <li> First week: Getting components connecting properly, and code the program.</li>
            <li>Second week: Finishing code and ensure all componet function properly to desire goal.</li>
            <li> Third week: Finsihing up any remain unfinished/issues and implementing mid-profile of a robot prototype to complete the visualization.</li>
          </ul>

        <h4 id="row-content">Schematic</h4>
        <p id="row-content">To tackle all the components that will be use in the project, first I want to ensure all the components are properly connect to the Arduino board, circuitboard, and to power without fearing that I will short circuit the components. <br>
        <br> For each components in the project:
        <ul>
          <li>Components I am familiar with:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>DC motor: I have touch based on this in my Assignment 5, and additional information gained from learning how to deal with noisy/whinning sound from the <a href="https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J15/9">Pololu</a> site. </li>
            <li>LEDs: I have touch on this in Assignment 1 and 2.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Components that are new:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>DHT11: For this component I utilize the information learned from the following sites: <a href="https://www.circuitbasics.com/how-to-set-up-the-dht11-humidity-sensor-on-an-arduino/">CircuitBasics</a>, and <a href="https://projecthub.arduino.cc/arcaegecengiz/using-dht11-12f621#section5">Arduino Docs</a>.</li>
            <li>IRreceiver: As for this I uses class slides, and the following sites <a href="https://www.circuitbasics.com/arduino-ir-remote-receiver-tutorial/">CircuitBasics</a>, and <a href="https://roboticsbackend.com/arduino-ir-remote-controller-tutorial-setup-and-map-buttons/">Robotics Back End</a> to incorporate the remote control.</li>
            <li>LCD 1602 module: <a href="https://www.circuitbasics.com/how-to-set-up-an-lcd-display-on-an-arduino/">CircuitBasics</a>, <a href="https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/electronics/lcd-displays/#display-example">Arduino Docs</a> are all the sites that help me learn how to connect all the neccessary pins to power. To create custom characters I also use this site: <a href="https://omerk.github.io/lcdchargen/">Custom Character Generator 5x8 byte</a> to help display the character on LCD display to indicate the temperature and humidity.</li>
            <li>Diode: This diode component is new, so I learn from the following: <a href="https://www.blikai.com/blog/what-is-a-1n4007-diode-and-how-is-it-used-in-circuits">blikai</a>, <a href="https://theengineeringmindset.com/the-basics-of-diodes-explained/">The engineering mindset</a> site, and class slides. <a href="https://www.exploringarduino.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1N400X-datasheet.pdf">Datasheet.</a></li>
            <li>Capacitor: From the <a href="https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J15/9">Pololu</a> site, and the video from <a href="https://theengineeringmindset.com/the-basics-of-diodes-explained/">The engineering mindset</a> guide me to utilize the capacitor to smooth out the noise coming from the DC motor.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <br> The components I uses for the project has numerous of wires, it is a challenge to show them through images, so I use the TinkerCad site to help me visualize all the connection of all the components.

          <ul>
            <li>LEDs:</li>
            <li>Blue LED:</li>

              <li>Wants: to power with 5V, and the desire current flow is 20mA</li>
              <li>V = I * R</li>
              <li>5V = 20mA * R</li>

            <li>Yellow LED:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Knowns: Yellow LED has a voltage drop of 1.8V</li>

            </ul>
          </ul>
          <li>Resistors: Based on the calculation above, I use three resistors each of 220 ohms. Since the yellow and red LED require a 160 ohms resistor to meet the desire amps, in the kit I have a 220 ohms and decided to used them for all three LEDs instead using a different one for the blue LED. Aside from the LEDs, there are two more resistor that were used for the LCD 1602 module. The resistor I decide to use for the LCD display were 220 ohms as well, after reading the Circuit Basics sites and testing the level of brightness the LCD 1602 module displaying using 220ohms.</li>
          <li>Transistor:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Is a active components that can use to control the flow of the current and amplify or switch electronic signal.</li>

        Although, I followed exactly how I did in Assignment 5, I still encounter whinning/noisy motor. Which cause the motor to not spin. Therefore I spend time learning how to tackle the issue. I learned that using the diode to prevent the inductive spike from the motor, and the capacitor to smooth out the noise from the motor. So to include them in the configuration I had, I change up wiring for the data pin as followed Figure 7.</p>

          <p>When I put the components together, I encounter issue that the wires went lose, and broke on me. <br><br>
          [This is when I didn't encounter noisy motor: no diode, or capacitor] The components run with no issue, then the wires start to get lose and detach. So I tried to soldering the first time, and have the components running again without issue. However, when I continue to compose other components the motor begin to detach again after a few operations. So I end up soldering a few more time, and swap wires to ensure the length of the wires aren't too short. I then test the motor with other components again, this is when I encounter noisy motor and figure out how to tackle the noisy motor with diode, and capacitor.<br><br></p>

        <p>After securing the components, I went ahead and finishing up the loof for the robot, which is hollow inside. I decided to added a placement for the remote control when they are not being used. I remove the blocks that covered the LEDs turns them to a small basket, attach them near the LEDs height. Which end up covering the hole I had to carve out for the IRreceiver. This covering is perfect because when the remote not being used, I don't have to worry about the oddly looking hole. However, when the remote being used I get to see where I should appoint the remote to. This allow the connect to the sensor being detect easily. View figure 21, and Figure 22.</p>

        <p id="row-content">Once all the components is being put together, I made a little demo on how it will operate. There are a few success I made which serve the intent of the robot: The fan is running after a few trial and errors, the LEDs turn on according to the temperature its detecting, the LCD displaying the information wanted, and the IRreceiver is detecting nicely. However, to every success there are obstacles I still need to figure out in the future. Due to time constraint and limited background on IRreceiver, I could not have the remote control the fan solely - means I couldn't have them increase the speed of the fan and stays at the increase state, or when decreasing. The on and off button doesn't goes as intented, too. This only meant that when I revisit the project and updating them, I would look into how to control the DC motor with remote control to the desire goal. <br><br>
        With the operating video, one small issue that I could not capture the temperature drop or increase smoothly as I wanted to.</p>
