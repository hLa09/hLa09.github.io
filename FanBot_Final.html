        <h3> Introduction: </h3>
        <p>I want to build a robot that turn on fan when the surrounding becames hot/humidity, and display the temperature on the display screen. My ultimately goal is to be able to let use changes the speed of the fan when neccessary. <br> <br>
        For this assignment I plan to have the following materials:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A Robot</li>
          <ul>
            <li>A prototype robot for visualization, and project completeness.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>LCD 1602 module</li>
          <ul>
            <li>To display the temperature of the surrounding</li>
          </ul>
          <li>DC motor and Fan</li>
          <ul>
            <li> To have the fan turning when temperature/ or surrounding get hot/humidity.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>LEDs indicators</li>
          <ul>
            <li> The purpose of the LEDs is to display the temperature meter</li>
            <li> For example: if the temperature cool it Blue, if it warm it's Yellow and while its hot it Red.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>DHT11 Temperature + Humidity</li>
          <ul>
            <li>I plan to use this to check for the surrounding temperature and humidity</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Remote</li>
          <ul>
            <li>My ultimate goal is to alos have user being able to change the speed of the fan, so I plan to have remote being implemented in the project.</li>
            <li> For say if the user want to control from afar they could.</li>
            <li> That means I would need an IR receiver to detect the code from the remote.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <p> <br>For this assignment timeline:
          <ul>
            <li> First week: Getting components connect correctly, and code neccessary</li>
            <li>Second week: Finishing code and ensure all componet function properly,and to desire goal.</li>
            <li> Third week: Finsihing up any remain unfinished and implementing low-mid profile of a robot prototype to complete the visualization.</li>
          </ul>
          <br><br>
        <strong><big>Let look out for details!</big></strong></p>
