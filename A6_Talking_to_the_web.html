        <figcaption> Fig 1: This image is show in side-view of what the circuit board for the Talking to the Web project. The circuit board has five LEDs: red, yellow, white, blue, and green. With five resistors, and five colored wires connecting to Arduino pin, along with six black wires connect to ground. Another component connect to the Arduino is the joystick, which has four wires connect to the Arduino: one for power (5V), one fore ground, one for VRX pin, and one for VRY pin.</figcaption>

        <h3> Introduction: </h3>
        <p>What did I do for assignment 6? I make the LED responsive to stick movement, and display on webpage! <br> <br>
        For this assignment the requirement was:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Must use a minimmum of 2 input devices from the Arduino</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Joystick counts as 2-3 inputs</li>
          </ul>
          <li>A minimmum of one output device from the Arudino</li>
          <ul>
            <li>An LED is one output</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Your wedbpage must show interactive, and update based on the input from Arduino</li>
          <li>For code:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Show a snippet of Javascript</li>
            <li>Show a snippet of Arduino Code</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <p> <br>Based on the requirements above, I choosed a Joystick and LEDs as input and output for the project. I plan to have each colored LEDs represent a direction the Joystick tilted towards. While the White LED represent the serial data receive, it will blink when there is serial data.<br><br>

        <h3>Schematic: </h3>
        <p> The following images are my schematics: the image ont he right display the bird-eye-view of the physical circuit, and the right display the sketch version of the schematic connection.<br> <br>
        When compare to the physical ciruit, we can see each colored (red, yellow, white, blue, green) wires is connected to a pin that are connected to power. Each LEDs is drawing individually rather than connected to a power source. The red wire connect to pin 2, Yellow wire connected to pin 4, White wire connect to pin 7, Blue wire connect to pin 12, nd Green wires connect to pin 13. While the black wires all connect to ground source. For the Joystick, there are four pin we going to use up on the Arduino, one is for the ground (black wire), one for the 5 Voltage (power, blue wire), one for the VRx connection to A1 - to indicate x position. Lastly, one for the VRy connect to A0, to indicate the y position of the Joystick. We can see that the sketch is referencing the physical circuit board, by the labeling and their connection.

        <h4 id="row-content">Resistors: </h4>
        <p id="row-content"> For this assingment I use LEDs as my output and I have five of them, here is the appropriate resistor value for each color LED was calculated as follow:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Red, Yellow, Green LEDs: (all have a voltage drop of 1.8V)</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Knowns: 5V, -1.8V drop, 20mA desire current</li>
            <li>Formula: Voltage (V) = I (current, A) * R (resistor, ohms)</li>
            <li>5V - 1.8V = 20mA * R</li>
            <li>3.2V = 0.02A * R</li>
            <li>R = 3.2V / 0.02 = 160 ohms</li>
          </ul>
          <li>The White and Blue LEDs: (both have a voltage drop of 3.3V)</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Knowns: 5V, -3.3V drop, 20mA desire current</li>
            <li>Formula: Voltage (V) = I (current, A) * R (resistor, ohms)</li>
            <li>5V - 3.3V = 20mA * R</li>
            <li>1.7V = 0.02A * R</li>
            <li>R = 1.7V / 0.02 = 85 ohms</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <p> Based on the calculation, the LEDs range of ohms fall in 85 ohms to 160 ohms. Which in the Arduino kit, I have 220ohm resitors that can apply for the LEDs. Though the White and Blue LEDs will be showing a dimmer light, as the resistor are higher than the calculation. However, it still won't cause a significant differents. <br><br>
        The purposed of using resistors is to limit the current flows through the LEDs. To ensure that each LEDs does not have a current flow over 20mA, I use resistor of 220 ohms per LEDs.<br> <br> </p>

And in the big canvas there's a stroke line that display where the coordinates ranges on the canvas and stroke line displaying where the Joysitck've been.</figcaption>

        <p> <br> For this project I have uses many reference to support me with the code for javascript: <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/p5/stroke/">Stroke line</a>, <a href="https://p5js.org/examples/animation-and-variables-drawing-lines/">Drawing lines</a>, <a href="https://p5js.org/tutorials/setting-up-your-environment/">Setting up my environment</a>, <a href="https://p5js.org/tutorials/variables-and-change/">Variable and changes</a>, <a href="https://www.toptal.com/developers/keycode">Key code</a>, <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/p5/keyIsDown/">KeyIsDown</a>. Not just that but I also uses example from class for the setting up serial, and declaring const of x, and y in Javascript using "rgb" example. And old example/homework from class: Blink to make LEDs blink for the serial available, and how to work with Joystick example done in class.
