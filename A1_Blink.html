        <h3> Introduction: </h3>
        <p>What this assignment about? Make LEDs blinking! <br> <br> While familiarize myself how to connect things on a breadboard, how to use Arduino board, and learning basic code in Arduino IDE.<br> <br>
        For this assignment the requirement was:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Contains 3 LEDs or more.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Any LEDs colors.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Limit the current flow using the resistors.</li>
          <li>In Arduino code:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Make the LEDs blink independently.</li>
            <li>Must add comments on code lines!</li>
            <li>Use digitalWrite()</li>
            <!-- <li>....</li> -->
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <p> <br> Beside the requirements, the name of the project makes sense itself! Using the LEDs and the Arduino to perform the Blinking effects. While limiting the current flowing through the LEDs using resistors - These resistors must be carefully calculated, and use appropriate resistors that corresponding to each LEDs. Beside having all the LEDs and resistors correctly connected on the breadboard, the circuit must connect to the Arduino and computer to be powered. Using Arduino IDE to code the function needed to perform the effect. For the Arduino part, I use the digitalWrite(), pinMode as output, and delay() function to assist me making the LEDS blinking individually.<br><br>

        <h3>Schematic: </h3>
        <p>For the schematics, the picture to the right show how the ciruict look in physical visualization. In the circuit board it consist of color coded wires, LEDs, and resistors. For each components on the board: the red wires indicate the power connection, while the black wires indicate ground connection. We have 3 LEDs on the board, they are Red LED, Yellow LED, and Green LED. Each of the LEDs has its own resistors to limit the current flow through, so there will be calculation for thoses in the calculation section. The Red LED connect to pin 2, and Yellow connect to pin 4, and Green connect to pin 7 on the Arduino board for power.<br> <br>Looking at the schematic drawing, we can see that each LEDs has it own power as they all are connect to individual pin, and connect to a resistor, then to the LED itself before connecting to the ground.</p>

        <h4 id="row-content">Calculation: </h4>
        <p id="row-content">Beside the LEDs and coding, there is a component called the resistors, here is the appropriate resistor value for each color LED was calculated as follow:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Red LED:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>knowns: 5 Volt, desire LED at 20mA current, Voltage drop (Red) = 1.8V.</li>
            <li>Formula: V = I(Amperes) * Resistance (Ohms)</li>
            <li> 5V - 1.8V = 20mA * R</li>
            <li> 3.2V = 20mA * R</li>
            <li> R = 3.2 / 0.02 = 160 Ohms</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Green LED:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>knowns: 5 Volt, desire LED at 20mA current, Voltage drop (Green) = 1.8V.</li>
            <li>Formula: V = I(Amperes) * Resistance (Ohms)</li>
            <li> 5V - 1.8V = 20mA * R</li>
            <li> 3.2V = 20mA * R</li>
            <li> R = 3.2 / 0.02 = 160 Ohms</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Yellow LED:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>knowns: 5 Volt, desire LED at 20mA current, Voltage drop (Yellow) = 1.8V.</li>
            <li>Formula: V = I(Amperes) * Resistance (Ohms)</li>
            <li> 5V - 1.8V = 20mA * R</li>
            <li> 3.2V = 20mA * R</li>
            <li> R = 3.2 / 0.02 = 160 Ohms</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <p> <br> For all of the LEDs: Red, Green, and Yellow require a resistor of around 160 Ohms, in which the closest resistor in my kit is resistor of 220 Ohms. As this resistor (220 Ohms) provide the closes resistances that each LEDs need, which I will have three of the 220 Ohms resistors on my circuit board to limit the currents Amperes passing through.<br> </p>

        <h4 id="row-content"> Code: </h4>
        <p id="row-content"> As mentioned there is a require function from the Arduino IDE to tell the LEDs how to behave to make the effects comes in to play. The following is a snippet of the Arduino code: <br> </p>

        <p> <br>For this program I want to program it similar to a street light, so the LED blinking in order of red, yellow, green, then yellow and red in repeat. </p>
        <p> <br> <strong> Additional Question: </strong> <br>
          <ul>
            <li>1. How many LEDs could you blink independently with your Arduino?</li>
            <ul>
              <li> How much current would that draw?</li>
            </ul>
            <li>2. How many LEDs could you blink with your Arduino if only one were to be on at once? </li>
            <li>3. How fast do you need to blink your LEDs until you no longer can tell that they are blinking?</li>
          </ul>
          <strong>Answer: </strong>
          <ul>
            <li>1. There are 14 General Purpose Input and Output (GPIO) pins in the arduino, from 0 to 13. Which we can run 14 LEDs independently. The number of current that would draw could be 20mA or less, similiarly to the project. I have three of my LEDs run independently, each has their own resistor, and from calculation if I have a resistor of 160 ohms then the LED will only draw 20mA per, though since I have 220 ohms connected, which can cause the current drawn to be less than 20mA (desire current).</li>
            <li>2. The number of LEDs could blink with the Arduino if were to be on at once are ...</li>
            <li>3. The fastest I can run my LED until I no longer can tell they are blinking is 50 milliseconds. Is run so fast that it become blur which cause the light to be seem dimming effect raher than blinking.</li>
          </ul>
