        <h3> Introduction: </h3>
        <p>What this assignment about? Make LEDs blinking! <br> <br> While familiarize myself how to connect things on a breadboard, how to use Arduino board, and learning basic code in Arduino IDE.<br> <br>
        For this assignment the requirement was:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Contains 3 LEDs or more.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Any LEDs colors.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Limit the current flow using the resistors.</li>
          <li>In Arduino code:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Make the LEDs blink independently.</li>
            <li>Must add comments on code lines!</li>
            <li>Use digitalWrite()</li>
            <!-- <li>....</li> -->
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <p> <br> Beside the requirements, the name of the project makes sense itself! Using the LEDs and the Arduino to perform the Blinking effects. While limiting the current flowing through the LEDs using resistors - These resistors must be carefully calculated, and use appropriate resistors that corresponding to each LEDs. Beside having all the LEDs and resistors correctly connected on the breadboard, the circuit must connect to the Arduino and computer to be powered. Using Arduino IDE to code the function needed to perform the effect. For the Arduino part, I use the digitalWrite(), pinMode as output, and delay() function to assist me making the LEDS blinking individually.<br><br>

        <h4 id="row-content">Calculation: </h4>
        <p id="row-content">Beside the LEDs and coding, there is a component called the resistors, here is the appropriate resistor value for each color LED was calculated as follow:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Red LED:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>knowns: 5 Volt, desire LED at 20mA current, Voltage drop (Red) = 1.8V.</li>
            <li>Formula: V = I(Amperes) * Resistance (Ohms)</li>
            <li> 5V - 1.8V = 20mA * R</li>
            <li> 3.2V = 20mA * R</li>
            <li> R = 3.2 / 0.02 = 160 Ohms</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Green LED:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>knowns: 5 Volt, desire LED at 20mA current, Voltage drop (Green) = 1.8V.</li>
            <li>Formula: V = I(Amperes) * Resistance (Ohms)</li>
            <li> 5V - 1.8V = 20mA * R</li>
            <li> 3.2V = 20mA * R</li>
            <li> R = 3.2 / 0.02 = 160 Ohms</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Yellow LED:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>knowns: 5 Volt, desire LED at 20mA current, Voltage drop (Yellow) = 1.8V.</li>
            <li>Formula: V = I(Amperes) * Resistance (Ohms)</li>
            <li> 5V - 1.8V = 20mA * R</li>
            <li> 3.2V = 20mA * R</li>
            <li> R = 3.2 / 0.02 = 160 Ohms</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <p> <br> For all of the LEDs: Red, Green, and Yellow require a resistor of around 160 Ohms, in which the closest resistor in my kit is resistor of 220 Ohms. As this resistor (220 Ohms) provide the closes resistances that each LEDs need, which I will have three of the 220 Ohms resistors on my circuit board to limit the currents Amperes passing through.<br> </p>
