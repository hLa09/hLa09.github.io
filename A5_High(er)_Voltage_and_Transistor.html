        <h3> Introduction: </h3>
        <p>What do we do with Assignment 5? Using external power supply and N-MOSFET transistor! <br> This assignment want us to use an external power supply to play around with N-MOSFET transistor. Since our Arduino can only supply up to 5 Voltage, some component would need more than 5V to perform. For this assignment, I use a capacitive sensor to receive signal range that allow the DC motor to run.<br> <br>
        For this assignment the requirement was:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Must use a N-MOSFET transistor</li>
          <li>Must use external power supply</li>
          <li>Must use an input sensor that uses a library</li>
          <ul>
            <li> -> here I will use capacitive sensor library.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>In Arduino code:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>should at least use analogWrite(). During pinMode() initializing.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <p> <br>For the component uses: I will use a DC motor, a coin for CapacitiveSensor acting as a sensor for signal. A power supply of 9 voltages, along with 1 Megaohm and N-MOSFET transistor to limit the currents following through the components.<br><br>

        <h3>Schematic: </h3>
        <p>In my schematic, I have two images to show how the components connecting to each others. There are Arduino and a external power supply is connecting to power. I also uses a external power supply module to assist me with connecting to the component without wiring mess. The image in the right show that the red wires are connect to some sort of power, one of the red wire is connected to the 5V of the Arduino to the power on the circuit. While the second red wire connecting from the circuit with the transistor to Arduino is insert in pin 9 and there is a red wire the coming from the motor contecting to the power band on the circuit that links to the external power supply. Beside the red wires, there is a black wires indicates ground connection of the components. However, there are one black wire coming from the motor is connected to the drain pin of the transistor. The remain color coded wires are orange and yellow. The orange is connect to pin 2, this is a sensor of the capactive sensor. Which leaves the yellow a receiver of the cacpacitive sensor connected to pin 4. Addition to wires connect from breadbboad to power, the aligator clip is connect with pin 2 of the resistor and the coin (metal object).<br> <br> When break it down in drawing it look much simplier, first on the left we have the capacitive sensor; where pin 2 is a sensor pin, and is being clip by a aligator clip connected to a 1M (megaohm) resistor to pin 4, a receiver. To the right is the connectors for the motor. Where we have power supple connect to the inductor (DC motors) and to the transistor, at the transistor we have one connect to pin 9, one connect to the negative wire of the motor (drain) one is connect to ground to avoid components shortage.

        <p id="row-content"> For this assignment: I uses 1M (megaohm) resistor to limit the currents floowing through the CapacitiveSensor, and a transistor.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Capacitive Sensor: (details on why resistor are are)</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Knowns: Capacitive sensor have multiple resistor choices (according to class lector notes and <a href="https://www.86duino.com/?p=5922"> Capacitive Sensor Library</a>)</li>
            <li>Use a 1 megaohm resistor (or less maybe) for absolute touch to activate.</li>
            <li>With a 10 megohm resistor the sensor will start to respond 4-6 inches away.</li>
            <li>With a 40 megohm resistor the sensor will start to respond 12-24 inches away (dependent on the foil size). Common resistor sizes usually end at 10 megohm so you may have to solder four 10 megohm resistors end to end.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Transistor:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Is a active components that can use to control the flow of the current and amplify or switch electronic signal.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p> <br>Based on the guideline for resistor, I intend to use the CapacitiveSensor for touched signaling, so I uses a 1M resistor. </p>

        <p> <br> Let take a look of what my circuit does in operation mode: at the start I have the CapacitiveSensor sit for five seconds to calibrating the range of the sensor, and set min and max value. See the image on the right for out put. Then I begin approaching the coin (sensor) so that the signal can be detected, and once signal pick up, we can see that the fan is spinning - the number is in the range. We can see that at first the sensor detect a value in range and then out of range, this is the glicth in the begining where I the signal pick up are too high the fan isn't running properly. The remain tries went smoother, as the value fall perfectly in the range. Having the motor run at the value speed, means the value that is being detected is the speed the motor runs. Although, the analogWrite() only read from 0 to 255, this is where the map function fit in, allow the value that is being read get convert to the necessary range.</p>
