        <figcaption> Fig 1: This image is show in side-view of what the circuit board for the Libraries project. The circuit board has a 7-segment display with resistors and wires connecting to Arduino. Another item that is connected to the Arduino is the capacitive sensor, which consist of one resistor and two wires act as send pin and receive pin. There is a aligator wire that will connect to the receive pin to an object.</figcaption>

        <h3> Introduction: </h3>
        <p>What is this assignment 4? Using Libraries! <br>To count the number of time the object is being touch by a person. <br> <br>
        For this assignment the requirement was:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To use more than one library,</li>
          <li>The design must include both input and output part</li>
          <li>In Arduino code:</li>
          <ul>
            <li> if* - using analogRead(),must write code to calibrates the sensor reading.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <p> <br>Beside the requirements. The intend of this project I want to have the component behave in a way that if I were to touch the metal object (I will be using a key) the sensor will detect and display the number in the 7-segment display screen. However this 7-segment display I will be using for this project will only be able to display number 0-9. Therefore I will only count the number of touch up to nine, and the program will restart counting from 0-9, if were to be touch more than 9 time. <br><br>

        <h3>Schematic: </h3>
        <p>The following is the schematic of the Libraries project which I used: I show them both in physical circuit board via bird-eye-view, and in sketch version. This is what the board look like to allow the function of the Arduino code to run properly. I have ... <br> <br>

        <h4 id="row-content">Resistors: </h4>
        <p id="row-content">Beside the 7-segment display and the capacitive sensor component, there is a component called the resistors, here is the appropriate resistor value for each resistors used:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>7-segments: This calcultion will be for per segments</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Knowns: 5 Volt, desire LED at 20mA current, Voltage drop (per segments) = 2V.</li>
            <li>Formula: V = I(Amperes) * Resistance (Ohms)</li>
            <li> 5V - 2V = 20mA * R</li>
            <li> 3V = 20mA * R</li>
            <li> R = 3 / 0.02 = 150 Ohms</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Capacitive Sensor:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Knowns: Capacitive sensor have multiple resistor choices (according to class lector notes)</li>
            <li>Use a 1 megaohm resistor (or less maybe) for absolute touch to activate.</li>
            <li>With a 10 megohm resistor the sensor will start to respond 4-6 inches away.</li>
            <li>With a 40 megohm resistor the sensor will start to respond 12-24 inches away (dependent on the foil size). Common resistor sizes usually end at 10 megohm so you may have to solder four 10 megohm resistors end to end.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <p> <br> The number I got for the 7-segment display for voltage draw was from <a href="https://www.farnell.com/datasheets/2095874.pdf?_ga=2.127782861.1566654749.1572523254-912966484.1572389117">Farnell Datasheet</a> found in the Arduino forum. The absolutemax forward current is the 25mA continuos, while at peak is 100mA. Although we are only looking at the continuos current flow, rather than at peak. also, the desire current flow is at 20mA, in which I use the 20mA current flow as a limit current. Looking at the graph the forward current per segment compare to the forward voltage, the range of the current is rise from 0 to 100mA is around 2V. Based on this information I assume the voltage drop will be at 2, and after calculation I ended with 150 ohms. The closest to the resistor I have is the 220 ohms resistors.<br><br>
        As for the Capacitive sensor, according to the notes and guidelines I decided to use 1M (megaohm) as my resistor for the sensing object. Because I would like to sense the number of time the object is being touched. [ Even though we will only be able to display the number from 0 to 9, when using one 7-segment display screen.]<br> <br> </p>
