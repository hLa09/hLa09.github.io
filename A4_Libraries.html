The circuit board has a 7-segments display with resistors and wires connecting to Arduino.

        <h3> Introduction: </h3>
        <p>What is this assignment 4 ask of us? Using Libraries! <br> Which means to use two different component from the kit that requires Library,have one component act as an input that other act as an output.<br> <br>
        For this assignment the requirement was:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To use more than one library,</li>
          <li>The design must include both input and output part</li>
          <li>In Arduino code:</li>
          <ul>
            <li> if* - using analogRead(),must write code to calibrates the sensor reading.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <p> <br>Beside the requirements above, the intend of this project is to have the component behave in a way that if I were to touch the metal object (here I will be using a key) the capacitive sensor will be detecting whether the object is touched and display the number of touches on the 7-segments display screen. However this 7-segments display that I will be using for this project will only be able to display number 0-9. Therefore I will only count the number of touches up to nine, and the program will restart counting from 1-9, if were to be touch more than 9 time. <br><br>

        <h3>Schematic: </h3>
        <p>The following is the schematic of the Libraries project: I show them both in physical circuit board via bird-eye-view, and in sketch version. This is what the board look like to allow the function of the Arduino code to run properly. I have one 7-segments display component connected to seven resistors, along with seven wires connect to the Arduino's pins and one ground wire connect to the Arduino's ground pin. This object act as an output part, as its display the number of touches. Another component on the circuit board is the resitor of 1M (megaohm), this one act as an input, has two wires connect to the Arduino pins : one is a receive pin, and the other is the sensor pin. Additional to the wires that connect to the resistor, there is an aligator wire that clip directly to the resistor on the sensor side which also clip onto a metal object (key). <br> <br>
        When comparing to the physical circuit, we can see that the

        <h4 id="row-content">Resistors: </h4>
        <p id="row-content">Beside the 7-segments display and the capacitive sensor component, there is a component called the resistors, here is the appropriate resistor value for each resistors used:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>7-segments: This calcultion will be for per segments</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Knowns: 5 Volt, desire LED at 20mA current, Voltage drop (per segments) = 2V.</li>
            <li>Formula: V = I(Amperes) * Resistance (Ohms)</li>
            <li> 5V - 2V = 20mA * R</li>
            <li> 3V = 20mA * R</li>
            <li> R = 3 / 0.02 = 150 Ohms</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Capacitive Sensor:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Knowns: Capacitive sensor have multiple resistor choices (according to class lector notes and <a href="https://www.86duino.com/?p=5922"> Capacitive Sensor Library</a>)</li>
            <li>Use a 1 megaohm resistor (or less maybe) for absolute touch to activate.</li>
            <li>With a 10 megohm resistor the sensor will start to respond 4-6 inches away.</li>
            <li>With a 40 megohm resistor the sensor will start to respond 12-24 inches away (dependent on the foil size). Common resistor sizes usually end at 10 megohm so you may have to solder four 10 megohm resistors end to end.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <p> <br> The number I got for the 7-segments display for voltage draw was from <a href="https://www.farnell.com/datasheets/2095874.pdf?_ga=2.127782861.1566654749.1572523254-912966484.1572389117">Farnell Datasheet</a> found in the Arduino forum. The absolute max forward current is the 25mA continuos, while at peak is 100mA. Although we are only looking at the continuos current flow, rather than at peak. Also, the desire current flow is at 20mA, in which I use the 20mA current flow as a limit current. Looking at the graph the forward current per segment compare to the forward voltage, the voltage began to draw is 2V rising with the current from 0 to 20mA. Based on this information I assume the voltage drop will be at 2, and after calculation I ended with 150 ohms. The closest to the resistor I have is the 220 ohms resistors.<br><br>
        As for the Capacitive sensor, according to the notes and guidelines I decided to use 1M (megaohm) as my resistor for the sensing object. Because I would like to sense the number of time the object is being touched. [ Even though we will only be able to display the number from 0 to 9, when using one 7-segment display screen.]<br> <br> </p>

        <p> <br> The function of the whole program is to have the 7-segments display increments from 0-9 when the metal object (key) is being touch. The Capacitive Sensor is the input sensing for the touch - the first five second of the program there is a calibrating that will determine the sensor minimum range and the maximum range, this help the detecting sensor behave more accurately when surrounded in environment with numerous of human being. After the sensor range is being determine, the capacitive sensor is waiting to detect whether the object is being touch, and when that is detected, the value will be greater than the sensor minimum. Which the counter will increments, and that increment will only be in the range of 0 to 9, where it will get display on the 7-segments display screen. When the count value reach higher then 9, and seem like the program is continous run the counter will reset to 1 instead of 0. The program will only display zero when its first startup, or that the object has never been touch since the program run.<br> Since I only use one segment display, it only make sense when the object is continous being touch to reset to value 1 when it previous touched value is at 9. If I were to use more than one display, this counter issue will be capture in a better way. Though it is my first time playing around with these segment display and the libraries, therefore I want to make sure I began where I can easily break down thing to understand and continous to build on it in the future projects.</p>
