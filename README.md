# Ha La’s HCDE 439 Physical Computing

My name is Ha La, a student from Human Centered - Design & Engineering department in the University of Washington.

The purpose of this site is to showcase what I will be doing in my “HCDE 439” - Physical Computing course. This will be my first time learning the materials so there will be plenty of things I will be struggling to make sense of and tons of mistake could occur. I will take this as a learning opportunity to gain as much information how to compute things physically, this page will documents how capable I am at first hand in these type of materials and I will further make changes.
